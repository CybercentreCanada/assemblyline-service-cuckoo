This is meant to be a relatively simply place to keep track of significant changes, with newest changes at the top

* AL-63 - vmcloak and building VMs better
    * Various backwards incompatible changes. Current VMs should continue to run fine with any existing cuckoobox
    docker containers, but if you use vmprep.py/import-vm.py to deploy any new VMs you will have to rebuild the cuckoobox
    container
    * allow the user to select a specific VM via the `analysis_vm` submission parameter
    * deprecate service configuration settings
        * `vm_meta` : the 'cuckoo.config' file is now dynamically generated by reading the _meta.json files based on the 
        virtual machines that are listed in the submission parameter 'analysis_vm'.
        * `ramdisk_size` : no longer using a ramdisk inside of the docker container - OS filesystem cache should be good enough for this

* AL-74, 66, 69
    * Fixed issue with full and process memory dumps
    * Using cuckoo.py/sysprep() to download VM metadata and disk images, which means you need to do a hostagent restart
     if any changes are made to the VM configuration. The update function now only checks for community updates.

* [Issue 25 vm better](https://bitbucket.org/cse-assemblyline/alsvc_cuckoo/pull-requests/88/issue-25-vm-better/diff)
    * Creation of `cuckoo_tests.py` script to be used on workers to help diagnose issues with docker & virtual machines
